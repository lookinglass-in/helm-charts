Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add lookinglass-in https://lookinglass-in.github.io/helm-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run `helm search repo lookinglass-in` to see the charts.
